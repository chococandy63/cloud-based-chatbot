Hello, my name is Riya Bisht. I am doing my Btech in computer science and engineering from Graphic Era University, Dehradun.
I love to play with computers and my hobbies are Reading, writing, travelling, and trying different foods.
I enjoy hacking Nix and Unikernels and WASM full-time. In my free time, I enjoy watching evil shows like Courage: The Crowdly Dog.
